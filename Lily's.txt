		<b>Title: The Flower I See</b><br/>

		To the flower I once lost,<br/>
		To the flower I once bought,<br/>
		Whose petals were unique from the rest<br/>
		Whose petals, colourful as the best<br/>
		Whose stalk was sturdy, strongly supporting its bloom above<br/>
		Whose roots once damaged, now firmly etched deep<br/>
		Whose value the seller failed to believe in<br/>
		Whose value I felt the moment I walked in<br/>
		To the flower to this day,<br/>
		Brings a familiar sense of peace and joy to this fool<br/>
		To the flower to this day,<br/>
		Struggled and made it to this moment, stronger yet still beautiful<br/>
		To the flower I hope to see<br/>
		Give rise to an entire garden of its kind<br/>
		To the flower I see<br/> 
		The flower like no other<br/>
		The flower I call Lily.
